# Study overview
Experiments were conducted with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. 
Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) 
wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, the
3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz were recorded. The experiments have been 
video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the 
volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals from accelerometers and gyroscopes were processed and raw data was imported into R.

# Variables
- Subject = the numerical identifier of the individual
- Activity = the type of activity performed by the individual 
      1 - WALKING 
      2 - WALKING_UPSTAIRS 
      3 - WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS 
      4 - SITTING 
      5 - STANDING 
      6 - LAYING

# Measurements
- Mean = average
- std = standard deviation
- Acc = Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer
- gyr = Triaxial Angular velocity
